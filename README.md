## Commands
All commands need to be preceded with the prefix `!`.

`!matchroom create [Matchroom-Name] [@Mention] <@<Mention...>` - Creates a matchroom with the pinged people. Also moves them into the created voicechannel if they are already in one.

`!matchroom close` - Only works in the text-channel of a matchroom. Closes the matchroom (revokes most permissions), but doesn't delete it. 

`!matchroom delete` - Only works in the text-channel of a matchroom. Completely deletes a matchroom. Use this if you want to get rid of evidence.
